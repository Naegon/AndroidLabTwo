# Lab: Asynchronous tasks and Sensors
### Lab two of Android Class (Java) in Efrei Paris fourth year
> Par J.-F. Lalande

This labs intends to work with HTTP request : a lot of Android applications need to interact with a remote server. A lot of libraries can help to do this, but the goal of this lab is to build your request by yourself. Before working with the service Flickr, we first setup a simple HTTP request that we will use to authenticate the user. Then, we will move to Flickr in order to display images in a ListView object.
